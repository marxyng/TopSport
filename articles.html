        <h1>Is Lebron Really the Goat?</h1>
        <p>When you say goat it means Greatest of all time.  The goat I would say has no weaknesses.
        The conversation is usually about Michael Jorden and Lebron James.  People are now giving
        it to Michael Jorden after last season performance.  If you are reading this in the future,
        we are talking about the 2021 season where his team did not make the playoffs.  If you ask 
        me, is Lebron good?  The answer is yes.  Is he the goat though?  The goat to me has to be
        the greatest offensive weapon, great on defense, and can get his team the chip.  Lebron
        is more Magic Johnson if we are being honest.  Nothing wrong with that, just not MJ.  Michael
        Jorden has to be the best player we have ever seen.  If you ever watch MJ highlight, you would be
        like dang man.  MJ had everything.  Also, there is a big difference in eras.  MJ's era was way more
        competitive.  I know some of the NBA players of today would be mad at me for saying that.  Kobe's
        era was more competitive as well.  I think when they got rid of hand checking, they made it
        easier for Lebron.  Lebron doesn't even have any big time centers in his era.  It is kind of 
        ridiculous to compare the two.  I wonder if Lebron was in MJ era, would he be better than
        Scottie Pipen to be honest.  Scottie Pipen was an amazing player especially on the defensive side.
        His offense got better later in his career.  Lebron was never super great at defense.  He
        is decent when it comes to defense.  I would say he would get you a couple of blocks from the
        week side in his prime, but he was never the best on the ball defender.  Lebron isn't 
        a Bruce Bowen.  Lebron wasn't going to shut down an Allen Iverson, MJ, Tracy McGrady, or any 
        great offensive weapon.  Lebron isn't good at free throws or three pointers.  MJ was ridiculous with the midrange shot.  Lebron is
        decent.  Lebron gets most of his points in the paint.  Think about if there was a Patrick Ewing,
        Shaq, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, and a Dikembe Mutombo.  The talent just isn't as 
        good in Lebron era as in MJ era.  Kobe is the closest to MJ. What Lebron has been able to
        do is stay healthy and start throughout his career.  Maybe we can call him the iron man or
        the player with the most endurance.  He has been able to play at a high level throughout
        his career.  You have to give his credit for that.  The truth is the talent is his era
        after McGrady, Kobe, and Spurs just wasn't there.  To be honest, I don't think Stephen Curry
        would be this good in MJ era.  Stepen Curry was there is Kobe era.  I remember him being
        shut down.  Stephen Curry is good, but I think he is overrated.  He is only able to do 
        what he does because of the rule changes, which helps him be a star.  He is Reggie Miller
        with a little bit more range and handles.  Overall,  Lebron's era just isn't as good as MJs.

    <h1> Who is the best point guard ever seen?</h1>
    <p>
    This is a great question.  If we are just talking about ever seen that could be tough.  If
    we are talking about the greatest of all time, that is a litte different.  Most people 
    would say Magic Johnson.  Some younger people that are Gen-Z would probably say Curry.  Sorry,
    it is not Curry, but he is good.  Truthfully, this is an extremely hard one.  Derrick Rose, was
    ridiculous in his prime before he got hurt.  He was looking better than Lebron back then.  Lebron
    won in the eastern championship against Rose, but it was only cause he had more help.  Lebron
    had Wade and Bosh.  Lebron has always had two other superstars I notice to win.  His other team
    he had Kyrie and Love.  The bubble I don't really count.  Allen Iverson might have been the best
    scoring point guard.  He was literally unstoppable because of his unbelievable speed and shot.
    He took his team to the championship basically by himself.  If it wasn't for Kobe and Shaq, Allen
    was probably be a NBA champion. Jordan would of shut down Stephen Curry and Kobe actually did. 
     Jorden couldn't shut down Allen Iverson though.  He slowed him down, but not shut him down. 
    Magic Johnson had a lot of talent around him.  So, not sure if I would pick him over some of the other talents.
    Magic was a great passer and flashy.  He won a bunch of championships, but could he have won if
    he didn't have all that talent around him?  You might want to pick Lebron as your point guard.
    Lebron is basically a point guard playing forward.  In other words, Lebron is kind of Magic
    Johnson or very similar.  How good was Pete Maravich?  I seen the footage of how good he was.  Don't
    forget Penny Hardway.  If he never got injured he might of became Kobe with Shaq.  Then again
    something like that wasn't happening while Jordan was playing.
    The safe bet is probably to go with Magic.

    <h1>Best big Man ever seen in basketball?</h1>
The best big man in the game ever seen?  Shaq is definitly in the conversation.  Shaq is probably
the most dominant center ever to play basketball.  We haven't seen anything like him since.  He 
dunked on everybody.  The only center that you might can say was better is Hakeem Olajuwon.  Hakeem
Olajuwon actually beat Shaq when Jordan retired the first time.  We can't forget Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
and Wilt Chamberlain.  Wilt is the only player to score 100 in a game. Kareem is the scoring champ,
but Lebron is about to pass him.  I look at that as an endurance thing.  It is a good feat though.
Ultimately, I'm going to give it to Shaq or Olajuwon.  I'm wondering could Olajuwon have beaten
Shaq when he was older and with the Lakers.  I'm not completely sure about this one.
